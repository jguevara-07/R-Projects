# R-Projects
This repository contains the research I conducted during my time as a Biostatistics Research Intern at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, under the guidance of Siyuan Ma, Ph.D.

My project investigated whether certain types of fungi are more commonly found in children with recurrent wheezing compared to those without, while adjusting for relevant covariates such as race/ethnicity, sex, and season of data collection.
